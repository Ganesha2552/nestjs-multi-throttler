# Contributions

Any and all contributions are welcome! This is a decently sized project with a good scoped of functionality.

## How to Contribute

1. Create a fork of the repository
2. Clone the code to your local machine
3. Create a new branch with the feature you are working on (e.g. WebSocket-Interceptor) or with the issue number (e.g. issue/42)
4. Run `yarn`
5. Implement your changes, ensure tests are still passing, or add tests if it is a new feature
6. Push back to your version on GitHub
7. Raise a Pull Request to the main repository

## Development

All the source code is in `src` as expected. Most of the code should be rather self documented.

## Testing

To run a basic dev server you can use `start:dev` to run `nodemon` and `ts-node`. All tests should be running through `jest` using `test:e2e` otherwise.

If you need to run tests for a specific context, use `yarn test:e2e <type>` (one of: controller, ws, gql) e.g. `yarn test:e2e controller` will run the e2e tests for the HTTP guard.

## Commits

We are using [Conventional Commit](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) to help keep commit messages aligned as development continues. The easiest way to get acquainted with what the commit should look like is to run `yarn commit` which will use the `git-cz` cli and walk you through the steps of committing. Once you've made your commit, prettier and eslint will run and ensure that the new code is up to the standards we have in place.

## Issues
